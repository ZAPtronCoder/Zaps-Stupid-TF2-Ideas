## The Spacial Awareness
I have a friend who recently started playing TF2, and the thing is they started playing Sniper. And they have gotten really good at playing Sniper. One small problem, they are half-deaf, so they end up lacking awareness (almost completely from my experience playing the game with him) while scoped in, if not in any situation as Sniper. So I thought of a cool idea that would supplement Sniper's usually mundane tactics.

I also think that this would be a better alternative to the **Razorback**, as the Spy can still backstab the Sniper, and it isn't just a counter to one class.

**`Weapon Stats:`**
```
Class: Sniper
Slot: Secondary [2]
Type: Backpack
```
```diff
+) Gain a radar that warns you of nearby enemies!
+) Radar will mark enemies that get too close
-) -10% move speed while scoped-in
-) -15 health points
```
**`Additional Info:`**
```diff
-) Replaces sub-machine gun.
=) Cannot be selected

```
• When an enemy gets within 400hu of the Sniper, the Sniper will be alerted and an arrow (pointing in 3D space) will display by their crosshair, alerting the Sniper to the enemy's position (pinging).
• When an enemy gets within 100hu of the Sniper, they will be marked for 3s. Marked players will be highlighted through walls.
• The enemy closest to the Sniper will be pinged, and only one enemy can be pinged at a time.
• Move speed penalty affects both scoping-in, and drawing back the Huntsman.
• The weapon will be displayed on the Sniper's back; a backpack (like the Cozy Camper) with a little radar dish and antennae poking out. The radar will flash when an enemy gets within pinging range, and the antennae will flash when an enemy gets within marking range. Just some small visuals to supplement the design of the weapon.

I love accessibility.
