• When you kill a player (revolver or knife), you gain a coin. This coin is displayed similarly to how Heads are displayed for the Eyelander.
• Alt-Firing will consume a coin from your pool and launch a projectile (at ~800hu, arcs) that you can shoot with your own revolver's bullets (it has a generous hitbox).
• Shooting the coin will cause your bullet to ricochet, hitting an enemy nearest to the coin (when it was shot) for Minicrit damage and a +25% damage bonus.
• You can chain two coins to deal full Crit damage with no damage bonus.
• Chaining additional coins adds +33% damage per coin.
• Coins can be launched at the same fire rate as the revolver.
• Coins can be airblasted by friendly and enemy pyros.
• Coins can be shot by friendly and enemy spies wielding the Thirty Pieces.
• You cannot cloak while holding the Thirty Pieces while it has coins.
