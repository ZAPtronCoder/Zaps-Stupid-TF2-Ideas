## The Cardiac Arrest
Think of a less stupid **Vaccinator**.

It provides a great deal of resistance during the übercharge, although not 100% resistance, and can theoretically last a long time. But once you stop overclocking...

...you will probably die.

**`Weapon Stats:`**
```
Class: Medic
Slot: Secondary [2]
Type: Medigun
```
```diff
=) Übercharge type: Overclock
+) +100% übercharge rate
+) No übercharge overheal penalty
-) -25% heal rate
=) Unstable übercharge overclocks patient's body, causing them to resist a great amount of damage!
=) After übercharge ends, accumulated damage is dealt to the patient
```
**`Additional Info:`**
```diff
+) +200% übercharge rate on übered targets
+) +25% heal rate on übercharged patient
-) -25% medigun beam length
-) -50% übercharge duration while not healing übered patient
=) Übercharge meter is consumed instantly
=) Can gain übercharge while healing übered patients
=) Übercharge lasts 6s
```
```
• Takes approximately 20s to gain full übercharge.
• Übercharge causes the patient to gain 50% damage resistance to all sources. Backstabs will only deal critical damage to patient.
• Conversely, the Medic will gain 25% damage resistance. Ditto backstab damage.
• All resisted damage will be applied to the patient and Medic after the übercharge ends.
• Takes approximately 5s to gain full übercharge off of an already übercharged patient.
• Can postpone übercharge ending by triggering it while already is ready (again). This can be done up to 5 times, theoretically postponing übercharge to 3 times the length of a normal über. This will also postpone the accumulated damage.
• If the accumulated damage were to kill, you or your patient will explode in a cloud of blood and gibs.
```
Having the possibility of postponing your übercharge ending by a lot at the cost of still being able to die during übercharge, and taking all resisted damage after it ends is very much a double-edged sword.

You could either play it safe and use it to temporarily buff a teammate, as if using the **Vaccinator**, or instead, go on a rampage that will end in both you and your patient exploding in a cloud of blood.
