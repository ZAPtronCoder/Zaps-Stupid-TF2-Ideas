## The Safety Precaution
Sacrifice your middling primary for a helmet that can save your life.

Just another layer of security for an already vulnerable class. You are sacrificing a weapon for a utility though.

**`Weapon Stats:`**
```
Class: Medic
Slot: Primary [1]
Type: Helmet
```
```diff
+) Sturdy helmet protects you from an instance of lethal damage!
-) You are more vulnerable without the helmet
=) Can be recharged with metal packs
```
**`Additional Info:`**
```diff
+) +15% explosive, fire, and melee damage resistance while active
-) +15% damage vulnerability while not active
-) Replaces syringe gun
=) Cannot be selected
```
```
• Upon taking lethal damage, a loud 'CLANK!' sound and visual is played and the would-be-lethal damage is reduced by 90% (at maximum 10 damage, health can only be reduced to a minimum of 1).
• After blocking a lethal shot, the Medic is MfD and given a speed boost for 3s.
• Can aquire a new helmet via resupply cabinet or by picking up any type of ammo pack. Does not work with scrap from a destroyed building.
• In the instance where a Medic would be on 1HP and with a helmet, block all damage and carry on.

Hey, I mean you can't just say it's a big ol' middle finger to the Sniper; it does affect other classes and is balanced by the fact you *are* more vulnerable without the helmet.

Yes this is a rework to that one idea by Panacek. Now without dumb flavor text.
