• Sentry fires unreflectable laser projectiles (at ~3000hu/s, no arc) that do heavy damage with slower fire rate.
• Sentry laser projectile has no damage fall-off.
• LEVEL 1 sentry stats:
  ◦ Base Damage: 35
  ◦ Attack Interval: 0.5s
  ◦ Ammo: 70 rounds
• LEVEL 2 sentry stats:
  ◦ Base Damage: 35
  ◦ Attack Interval: 0.25s
  ◦ Ammo: 100 rounds
• LEVEL 3 sentry stats:
  ◦ Base Damage: 35
  ◦ Attack Interval: 0.25s
  ◦ Sentry gains a hitscan laser attack that does 70 damage with no fall-off. (Has same reload speed as base sentry rocket salvo.)
  ◦ Ammo: 100 rounds, 10 salvos
• Alt-Fire causes the player to do a heavy melee swing attack, giving them a guarenteed melee Mini-Crit.
• This Alt-Fire has a 5s cooldown dictated by a meter that is displayed where the ammo counter would be while holding the melee.
• Missing any melee swing (Alt-Fire or not) causes the player to be MfD for 5s.
• Wrench looks like a pipe wrench, the handle would be team colored.
• Sentry design would be inspired by the Laser Cannon dartling gunner gun from BTD6 (funny, I know) and the Anti-Mass Spectrometer from Half-Life.
• Sentry would have glowing details similar to that of the teleporter building.
