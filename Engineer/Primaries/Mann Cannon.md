## The Mann-Cannon
Just launch stuff at them, what are they going to do?

A funny primary that enables the Engineer to do stuff like launch a sentry at the enemy team, or put a teleporter in a funny spot.

And yes, I understand this name has been thrown around a ton. Who the hell cares, I can have something that shares a name with something else.

```
• Gun fires balls of scrap instead of bullets. Scrap balls travel at ~700hu/s and arc. Projectile doesn't explode and deals 45 damage on impact with an enemy.
• Pressing reload while holding a building (either placing one down initially or picking up an already deployed building) will cause you to load it into the cannon.
• You cannot load a building in the cannon while under 10 ammo and 75 metal.
• While a building is in the cannon, a line dictating the trajectory of the building will be projected. The impact site will either display an X, or an outline of the building with a blueprint (like when placing down a building normally).
• Firing the cannon while the building is able to land in a valid spot will cause you to shoot out your building (bundled in a toolbox, just like with buildings normally) consuming 10 ammo and 75 metal.
• The building will follow the projected trajectory (which is the same as the scrap ball) and will deal damage and knockback enemies greatly (in a 45hu radius, deals 60 damage on direct hit) and will have +50% boosted construction speed for the first 1 second of it landing.
