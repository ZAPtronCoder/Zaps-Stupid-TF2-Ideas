## The Vacuumulator
To go with this surge ideas I have for alternative weapons, enjoy this dumb idea for a **Phlogistonator** replacement.

**`Weapon Stats:`**
```
Class: Pyro
Slot: Primary [1]
Type: Flamethrower
```
```diff
+) +25% primary ammo
-) -15% damage penalty
=) Airblast sucks in targets and projectiles
=) Consumed projectiles provide 1 stored Minicrit
=) Press Reload to consume stored Minicrits and boost yourself!
```
**`Additional Info:`**
```diff
+) -95% airblast cost
-) -25% airblast range
-) Airblast destroys projectiles
=) Airblast pulls in targets
```
```
• Airblast triggers 25 times per second while Alt-Fire is held down.
• Airblast has incredibly reduced, and reversed, knockback. It will pull in targets like a vacuum.
• Destroying a projectile provides 1 stored Minicrit.
• Pressing Reload will consume all stored Minicrits, and provide [1.2 times the amount of stored Minicrits] seconds of Minicrits boost.
```
Funny vacuum Pyro.
